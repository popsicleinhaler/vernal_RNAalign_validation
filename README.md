# vernal_RNAalign_validation
QLS rotation 1 - waldispuhl lab

Objective: 
estimate structural similarity of motifs in clusters and compare within the same cluster and between clusters


must be within the vernal environment

Running RNA-align all to all in a directory:
  must have a list of the cif file names to compare
    command:
  use this bash script for 
  
example cif structure:
example instance cif recovered with biopython:
example instance cif following edit to fix biopython cif creation issues:

Results:
  with QCPS (advantage: same size)
  with RNA-align :
